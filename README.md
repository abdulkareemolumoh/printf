Printf Project
This is a custom implementation of the printf function in C programming language. The printf function is used to format and print text in the console or other output streams. This project aims to provide a basic version of printf with support for commonly used format specifiers.

Features
Support for format specifiers such as %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %o, %x, %X, %f, and %p.
Ability to handle variable number of arguments.
Customizable output stream, including support for standard output (stdout) and file output.
Support for formatting options such as field width, precision, and flags.
Error handling for invalid format specifiers.
Usage
To use this printf implementation in your C project, you can include the printf.h header file and call the my_printf function with the desired format specifier and arguments. The function returns the number of characters printed.

Example usage:

#include "printf.h"

int main() {
	int num = 42;
	float pi = 3.14159;
	char str[] = "Hello, world!";

	my_printf("Integer: %d\n", num);
	my_printf("Float: %.2f\n", pi);
	my_printf("String: %s\n", str);

	return 0;
}
The above code will print the following output:

Integer: 42
Float: 3.14
String: Hello, world!
Supported Format Specifiers
This printf implementation supports the following format specifiers:

%c: Character
%s: String
%d or %i: Signed decimal integer
%u: Unsigned decimal integer
%o: Unsigned octal integer
%x or %X: Unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase or uppercase)
%f: Floating point number
%p: Pointer
Please refer to the standard C printf documentation for more information on format specifiers and their usage.

Formatting Options
This printf implementation also supports various formatting options that can be used in conjunction with format specifiers:

Field Width: Specified by a positive integer value, it specifies the minimum width of the printed field. If the value to be printed is shorter than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the - flag is used).
Precision: Specified by a period (.) followed by a positive integer value, it specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed for strings or the number of digits after the decimal point for floating point numbers.
Flags: Flags can be used to modify the behavior of format specifiers. Supported flags are:
-: Left-justify the field within the given width.
+: Print a plus sign (+) for positive signed integers.
0: Pad the field with zeros instead of spaces.
#: Prefix the output value with an appropriate prefix (e.g., 0x for hexadecimal numbers).
Please refer to the standard C printf documentation for more information on formatting options and their usage.

Error Handling
This printf implementation provides basic error handling for invalid format specifiers. If an invalid format specifier is encountered, an error message will be printed to the standard error (stderr) stream and the function will return a negative value to indicate an error.
